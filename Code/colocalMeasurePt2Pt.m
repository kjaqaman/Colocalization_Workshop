function [cT, cNull, cCritical,estimatorM, estimatorC] = colocalMeasurePt2Pt(detectionRef,detectionObs, threshold, maskingFile,alphaValue)
%COLOCALMEASUREPT2PT measures the colocalization between two punctate channels
%
%   Synopsis: [cT, cNull, cCritical,estimatorM, estimatorC] = colocalMeasurePt2Pt(detectionRef,detectionObs, threshold, maskingFile)
%
%   Function analyzes the distances of nearest neighbors between two
%   punctate channels and uses a distance threshold to ouput the probability of
%   finding points in the observed channel that colocalize with points in the
%   reference channel, the associated interaction potential (see source below)
%   and the null hypothesis values for both of these.
%Input:
% detectionRef: Detected positions of molecules in the reference channel
%
%
% detectionObs: Detected positions of molecules in the observed channel
%
%
% Threshold: distance threshold for possible interacting objects
%
% Masking File: This should either be a binary mask, or if no mask is given then the size of the image should be input
%               to create a mask of all ones
%
% alphaValue: alpha value used for calculating cCritical from binomial
%             distribution based on cNull
%
%
% Output:
% cNull (Null Hypothesis): probabilty of finding a distance <= threshold to
%   a detection in detectionRef under the null hypothesis (No interaction)
% %
% cT (Colocalization Measure): probabilty of finding a detection in detectionObs
%   a distance <= threshold to a detection in detectionRef
%
% cCritical: minimum probability to required to reject null hypothesis
%
% estimatorC (Critical Potential): Minimum interaction potential require to reject
%   null hypothesis
%
% estimatorM (Calculated Potential): Calculated interaction potential from data
%
% Estimator methodology adapted from "Beyond co-localization: inferring
% spatial interactions between sub-cellular structures from microscopy
% images" - Helmuth et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010
% Anthony Vega 09/2014
%
%Jesus Vega-Lugo Nov. 2020 modified cT calculation. Now uses  cT = fraction
%of colocalize objects instead of estimating colocalization fraction with
%ksdensity.
