function [dm, dmVectors] = distMat2(A,B,metric)
%DISTMAT2 computes the distance matrix of two point sets
%
% SYNOPSIS dm = distMat2(A,B,metric);
%
% INPUT:  A, B: Arrays containg rowA, rowB points with nCol dimensions.
%         metric (optional): weight of the dimensions
%
% OUTPUT: dm: rowA-by-rowB array of distances between points in A and B
%         dmVectors: rowA-by-rowB-by-nDimensions array of distance vectors
